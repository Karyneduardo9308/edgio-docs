# Performance Dashboard {/*performance-dashboard*/}

The Performance Dashboard provides a comprehensive snapshot of your company's performance and summarizes information in the Traffic Report and Status Codes Report. The Performance Dashboard is different from the older [Dashboard](/delivery/control/dashboard), which is also available.

The Performance Dashboard comprises two sections:

- The top section consists of tabs that show key performance metrics for the Delivery product, such as average bandwidth.

- The lower section provides information about leading metrics, such as locations with the highest data transfer rate. Information is displayed in card format.

<Callout type="info">The content of the lower section does not vary when you select a different tab in the top section; the two sections are independent.</Callout>

By default, data presented is an aggregate of all your company's accounts.

Instructions for using the Performance Dashboard are in these sections:
