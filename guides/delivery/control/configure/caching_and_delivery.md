Caching & Delivery delivers content via HTTP and HTTPS for all file formats. Both full (entire file) and progressive (range request) downloads are supported.

Navigate to Configure > Caching & Delivery (v2) in the navigation pane. The Caching & Delivery for page is displayed.

## Configuration List {/*configuration-list*/}
The Caching & Delivery page displays a list of the Caching & Delivery configurations for the currently-selected Company and Account.

The following information is shown for each configuration:

- **Source Hostname** â€“ The private URL prefix used by Edgio to retrieve and cache content from your origin server (not visible to end-users)
- **Source Path**- the URL path, if any, to use with the Source Hostname
- **Protocol** - The level of HTTP protocol security to use when delivering your cached content to end-users
- **Published Path** - The URL path, if any, to use with the Published Host
