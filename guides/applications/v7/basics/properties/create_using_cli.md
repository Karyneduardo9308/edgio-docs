## Creating a Property Using the CLI {/* create-property-using-cli */}

Use this method if you have an existing codebase and want to initialize and deploy a new property using the CLI. This method is ideal for users who are comfortable with the command line and prefer an interactive setup process.

**To create a property using the CLI:**

1.  From the {{ PORTAL_LINK }}, access your preferred environment:
    - **Private Space:** This is the default view in {{ PORTAL }} and only you can access the properties created here.
    - **Organization:** To access an organization space, click on the <Image inline src="/images/v7/icons/menu-up-down.png" alt="Menu" /> icon next to your profile and select the organization.
