Get started with {{ PRODUCT }} by performing these steps:

1.  [Create an {{ PRODUCT }} account.](#create-account)
2.  [Create an {{ PRODUCT }} property.](#create-property)
3.  [Test your property.](#test-your-property)
4.  [Next steps.](#next-steps)

## Step 1: Create an {{ PRODUCT }} Account {/*create-account*/}

Signing up for an {{ PRODUCT }} account is free and quick.

1.  [Sign up now by either:]({{ APP_URL }}/signup)

    -   Manually creating an account.
        1.   Provide your name, email (user name), and a password. Click **Create Account**.
        2.   Check your email for confirmation instructions. Click **CONFIRM MY ACCOUNT** to load the {{ PORTAL }}.
    -   Using your existing Github or Google account. You will need to log in to Github or Google and then authorize linking {{ PRODUCT }} to your account.

2.  Click **Accept** to accept our terms of service and privacy policy.

## Step 2: Create an {{ PRODUCT }} Property {/*create-property*/}

Each website that will run behind {{ PRODUCT }} requires an {{ PRODUCT }} property. A property determines how {{ PRODUCT }} will process your website's traffic. Set up for a new property varies according to whether you are hosting:

-   **A Project on Your Own Web Server(s):** This type of setup, also known as self-hosted, allows {{ PRODUCT }} to serve traffic for static or dynamic content generated by your web servers. For example, you may serve traffic for content that is available through web hosting or virtual cloud services.
-   **An Existing Project on {{ PRODUCT }}:** This type of setup allows you to take a CDN-as-code approach to managing your CDN configuration.  This means that you may configure CDN behavior within a file stored alongside your code. This allows you to manage it through source control and link it to specific versions of your application. 

    Choose from the following options:
    -   **Popular Web Application Framework:** If your existing project is stored within a Git repository and it is powered by Next.js, Nuxt3, Astro, Remix, Qwik, or Vue, then you may either initialize your property using our CLI or connect your repository to {{ PRODUCT }}. Connecting your repository to {{ PRODUCT }} automates branch previews whenever you push committed changes to a remote branch. It also automates the deployment of your site whenever you merge changes into your main branch. This option requires you to connect your Github account to your {{ PRODUCT }} account.
    -   **All Other Existing Projects:** You may initialize any project, regardless of framework, using our CLI. 
-   **Sample Web Application Framework Project on {{ PRODUCT }}:** We provide sample Next.js, Nuxt3, Astro, Remix, Qwik, and Vue projects through which you may learn how to optimize site delivery. This option requires you to connect your Github account to your {{ PRODUCT }} account.

1.  From the {{ PORTAL }}, click **+ New Property**.

2.  Perform either of the following steps:

    -   **Self-Hosted (External Origin):** From under the **Self Host Property**, click **Create Property**. Proceed to step 3.

    -   **All Other Options:** 

        1.  From under the **Host Property on {{ PRODUCT }}**, click **Create Property**.
        2.  From the **Property Name** option, assign a name to your property. 
        3.  Perform the step that best describes your setup:

            -   **Popular Web Application Framework with Automation:** Automate branch previews and deployments for a Next.js, Nuxt3, Astro, Remix, Qwik, or Vue project.

                1.  Click **Import an existing project**.
                2.  Click on your project's web application framework. If your desired framework is not listed, then you will need to follow the **All Other Existing Projects** workflow.
                3.  If you have not already connected your Github account to {{ PRODUCT }}, then you will to do so now.

                    1.  Click **Connect to Github**. 
                    2.  Sign in to your account using either a passkey or your user name and password.
                    3.  When prompted, authorize {{ PRODUCT }} access to your Github account.
                    
                4.  From the **Select a Repository** option, select your project's repository.
                5.  Click **Create Property**.
                6.  A quick start page will display a npx command. Initialize your property by running this command from your project's root directory. 
                
                    [Learn more about initialization.](/guides/performance/cdn_as_code#initialize-property)

            -   **All Other Existing Projects:** Use a CDN-as-code approach to CDN configuration with any existing project.

                1.  Verify that the **Create using CLI** option is selected.
                2.  Click **Create Property**.
                3.  A quick start page will display a npx command. Initialize your property by running this command from your project's root directory. 
                
                    [Learn more about initialization.](/guides/performance/cdn_as_code#initialize-property)

            -   **Sample Web Application Framework Project:** Examine a sample property to gain insight into how to optimize delivery for your site.
            
                1.  Click **Start from a template**.
                2.  Click on your project's web application framework. If your desired framework is not listed, then you will need to follow the **All Other Existing Projects** workflow.
                3.  If you have not already connected your Github account to {{ PRODUCT }}, then you will to do so now.

                    1.  Click **Connect to Github**. 
                    2.  Sign in to your account using either a passkey or your user name and password.
                    3.  When prompted, authorize {{ PRODUCT }} access to your Github account.
                    
                4.  From the **Select a Repository** option, select your project's repository.
                5.  Click **Create Property**.
                6.  A quick start page will display a npx command. Initialize your property by running this command from the directory where this project will live.
                
                    [Learn more about initialization.](/guides/performance/cdn_as_code#initialize-property)

3.  In the **Property Name** option, assign a name to your new property (e.g., `My Property`).
4.  Under the **Hostnames** section, click **+ Add Hostname** and then type a domain (e.g., `www.example.com` or `cdn.example.com`) that will be served through {{ PRODUCT }}.

    ![+ New Property](/images/v7/basics/property-create-2.png?width=450)

5.  An origin configuration identifies a set of web servers that will serve as the source for the content served through {{ PRODUCT }}.

    Perform one of the following steps:

    -   **Origin:** Define the set of web servers that will serve as the origin for the hostname defined in step 3 by setting the **Origin Hostname** option to a domain or an IP address (e.g., `www-origin.example.com` or `192.0.2.222`) that points to them. 

        <Callout type="info">

          You may safely ignore the other origin settings until you are ready to fine-tune your setup. [Learn more about origins.](/guides/basics/hostnames_and_origins#origin)

        </Callout>

        Your origin configuration should now look similar to this:

6.  Click **Create Property**.
7.  If you have defined at least one origin configuration, your property will be automatically deployed to the {{ PRODUCT }} network. [Proceed to Step 3: Test Your Property.](#test-your-property)

## Step 3: Test Your Property {/*test-your-property*/}

Once your property is successfully deployed to the {{ PRODUCT }} network, a URL will appear within the **Latest Production Deployment** section. Follow that link to preview your site behind {{ PRODUCT }}.

## Next Steps {/*next-steps*/}

Congratulations on setting up a basic property on {{ PRODUCT }}! 

You are now ready to:

-   Fine-tune your [origin configuration](/guides/basics/hostnames_and_origins#origin).

    For example, you can enable Server Name Indication (SNI) on an origin configuration or shield it from requests to reduce network bandwith usage and the load on your web servers.

-   If you plan on collaborating with other team members, then you should [create an organization](/guides/basics/collaboration). After which, you will need to <!--either -->create a property for that organization<!-- or [transfer the ownership of your new property](/guides/basics/properties#transfer-ownership) to that organization-->.
-   [Create environments](/guides/basics/environments) to match your software development workflow. Each environment provides site previews that allow QA testers, code reviewers, and other stakeholders to immediately try out newly introduced changes before they are introduced into your production environment. 
-   Set up {{ PRODUCT }} [Performance.](/guides/performance/getting_started) Learn how to:
    -   Optimize website performance by defining a [caching policy](/guides/performance/caching), [predictive prefetching](/guides/performance/prefetching), and other edge logic through [Rules](/guides/performance/rules). Alternatively, if you prefer code to UI, then you can take advantage of our [CDN-as-code approach](/guides/performance/cdn_as_code/getting_started) to CDN configuration.
    -   Gain performance insights through which you can fine-tune your configuration through our [Observability](/guides/performance/observability/real_user_monitoring) solution.
    -   Speed up development by quickly iterating through different variations of your site through our [Traffic Splitting](/guides/performance/traffic_splitting) solution.
-   Set up {{ PRODUCT }} [Security.](/guides/security) We automatically provide distributed denial-of-service (DDOS) protection to traffic that runs behind {{ PRODUCT }}. Apply additional protection to your web applications and APIs through our [Web Application Firewall solution](/guides/security/waf). {{ ACCOUNT_UPGRADE }}
-   Set up {{ PRODUCT }} [Sites.](/guides/sites_frameworks/getting_started) If you are currently using a JavaScript framework, then you can improve your website's performance by using our cloud workers to quickly render server-side content in a scalable manner.
