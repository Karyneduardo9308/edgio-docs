This guide shows you how to deploy a [Sanity Studio](https://www.sanity.io/docs/sanity-studio) application to {{ PRODUCT }}.

Sanity Studio is a single page app (SPA) written in React, where you can configure the document types and input fields, with simple JavaScript objects. This guide will walk you through how to deploy Sanity Studio with {{ PRODUCT }}.

## Example {/*example*/}

{{ PREREQ }}

## Create a new Sanity Studio app {/*create-a-new-sanity-studio-app*/}

First, install the [Sanity CLI](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@sanity/cli):

```bash
npm i -g @sanity/cli
```

To initiate a new project and download the Studio code to your computer, run the following in the command line:

```bash
sanity init
```

The Sanity CLI will walk you through the necessary steps to set up a project, letting you choose a schema template. When you're done with these steps, the CLI will download the source code and configuration to get you started. To start a local development server, cd into the project folder and run the following command:

```bash
sanity start
```

## Configuring your Sanity Studio app for {{ PRODUCT }} {/*configuring-your-sanity-studio-app-for*/}

### Initialize your project {/*initialize-your-project*/}

In the root directory of your project run `{{ FULL_CLI_NAME }} init`:

```bash
{{ FULL_CLI_NAME }} init
```

This will automatically update your `package.json` and add all of the required {{ PRODUCT }} dependencies and files to your project. These include:

- The `{{ PACKAGE_NAME }}/core` package
- The `{{ PACKAGE_NAME }}/cli` package
- The `{{ PACKAGE_NAME }}/sanity-studio` package
- `{{ CONFIG_FILE }}`- Contains various configuration options for {{ PRODUCT }}.
- `routes.js` - A default routes file that sends all requests to the Sanity Studio. Update this file to add caching or proxy some URLs to a different origin.

## Routing {/*routing*/}

The default `routes.js` file created by `{{ FULL_CLI_NAME }} init` sends all requests to Sanity Studio server via a fallback route.

```js
const { Router } = require('{{ PACKAGE_NAME }}/core/router')
const { sanityRoutes } = require('{{ PACKAGE_NAME }}/sanity-studio')

export default new Router({ indexPermalink: false }).use(sanityRoutes)
```

## Running Locally {/*running-locally*/}

To test your app locally, run:

```bash
{{ FULL_CLI_NAME }} run
```

You can do a production build of your app and test it locally using:

```bash
{{ FULL_CLI_NAME }} build && {{ FULL_CLI_NAME }} run --production
```

Setting `--production` runs your app exactly as it will be when deployed to the {{ PRODUCT }} cloud.

## Deploy to {{ PRODUCT }} {/*deploy-to*/}

Deploy your app to the {{ PRODUCT }} cloud by running the following command in your project's root directory:

```bash
{{ FULL_CLI_NAME }} deploy
```

## Post Deployment Whitelisting {/*post-deployment-whitelisting*/}

Once Sanity Studio is deployed, you will need to add it's URL to Sanityâ€™s [CORS origins settings](https://www.sanity.io/docs/front-ends/cors). You can do this from the command line:

```bash
sanity cors add https://your-url.{{ PRODUCT_LEGACY_LOWER }}-limelight.link --credentials
```

Alternatively, you can navigate to [manage.sanity.io](https://manage.sanity.io), find your project and under Settings > API, add the Studio URL to the CORS origins list. You should allow credentials as the Studio requires authentication for added security.
